# Conceptual Search Notebooks
These are a list of python jupyter notebooks for running the conceptual search code. These should be run in order (1,2,3, and any 4) to process the files (1), generate keywords and phrases (2), train the Word2Vec model (3), and then 4a or 4b or 4c to output either vector, top n term or cluster synonym files (see Lucene Revolution 2015 Talk http://lucenerevolution.org/sessions/implementing-conceptual-search-in-solr-using-lsa-and-word2vec/). The parameters for the notebooks are in the top notebook cell. Note that the notebooks typically depend on the output from a previous step.
